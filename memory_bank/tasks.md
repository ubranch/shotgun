## current task

- [x] initialize van mode
- [x] verify environment and files
- [x] analyze task complexity
- [x] narrate plan and next steps

## complexity determination

task: examining shotgun project structure and understanding Step2ComposePrompt.vue modifications

assessment:
- scope: focused on a single component (Step2ComposePrompt.vue)
- design decisions: simple (understanding existing code changes)
- risk: low (initial analysis, not making changes yet)
- implementation effort: low (analysis phase)

keywords identified: examine, understand

determination: level 1 - quick bug fix

## plan

next steps:
1. transition to implement mode for level 1 task
2. examine the specific changes in Step2ComposePrompt.vue that need attention
3. understand and document the purpose of these changes
4. determine the appropriate fixes if needed
5. implement and test any required changes
6. verify that the component works as expected
