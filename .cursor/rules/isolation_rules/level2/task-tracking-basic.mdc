# basic task tracking for level 2

> **tldr:** this document outlines a streamlined task tracking approach for level 2 (simple enhancement) tasks. it provides a balanced framework for managing task progress with minimal overhead.

## 🔍 task tracking overview

level 2 tasks require a more structured tracking approach than level 1, but don't need the comprehensive tracking of higher-level tasks. this basic tracking system provides sufficient structure while maintaining efficiency.

## 📋 task tracking principles

1. **clarity**: tasks should be clearly defined
2. **visibility**: progress should be visible at a glance
3. **structure**: break work into logical subtasks
4. **updates**: keep progress regularly updated
5. **completion**: clearly mark when tasks are done

## 📋 task structure for level 2

```markdown
## [feature name] enhancement

**status**: [not started/in progress/complete]
**priority**: [high/medium/low]
**estimated effort**: [small/medium/large]

### description
[brief description of the enhancement]

### requirements
- [requirement 1]
- [requirement 2]
- [requirement 3]

### subtasks
- [ ] [subtask 1]
- [ ] [subtask 2]
- [ ] [subtask 3]

### dependencies
- [dependency 1]
- [dependency 2]

### notes
[any additional information or context]
```

## 📋 tasks.md organization

organize tasks.md with these sections for level 2 tasks:

```markdown
# tasks

## active enhancements
- [enhancement 1] - [status]
- [enhancement 2] - [status]

## enhancement details
### [enhancement 1]
[task structure as above]

### [enhancement 2]
[task structure as above]

## completed enhancements
- [x] [completed enhancement 1] (yyyy-mm-dd)
- [x] [completed enhancement 2] (yyyy-mm-dd)
```

## 📋 updating task status

update tasks using this process:

1. **starting a task**:
   - update status to "in progress"
   - add start date to notes

2. **progress updates**:
   - check off subtasks as completed
   - add brief notes about progress
   - update any changed requirements

3. **completing a task**:
   - update status to "complete"
   - check off all subtasks
   - move to completed enhancements
   - add completion date

## 📋 subtask management

for level 2 tasks, subtasks should:

1. be actionable and specific
2. represent approximately 30-60 minutes of work
3. follow a logical sequence
4. be updated as soon as completed
5. include verification steps

example of well-structured subtasks:
```markdown
### subtasks
- [ ] review existing implementation of related features
- [ ] create draft ui design for new button
- [ ] add html structure for new component
- [ ] implement button functionality in javascript
- [ ] add appropriate styling in css
- [ ] add event handling
- [ ] test on desktop browsers
- [ ] test on mobile browsers
- [ ] update user documentation
```

## 📋 progress visualization

use progress indicators to show status:

```markdown
### progress
[###-------] 30% complete
```

for subtasks:
```markdown
### subtasks (3/10 complete)
- [x] subtask 1
- [x] subtask 2
- [x] subtask 3
- [ ] subtask 4
- [ ] subtask 5
```

## 📋 tracking verification checklist

```
✓ task tracking verification
- task clearly defined? [yes/no]
- requirements listed? [yes/no]
- subtasks created? [yes/no]
- dependencies identified? [yes/no]
- status up-to-date? [yes/no]

→ if all yes: task tracking is adequate
→ if any no: update task tracking
```

## 📋 minimal mode tracking

for minimal mode, use this format:

```
✓ task: [enhancement name]
✓ status: [in progress/complete]
✓ subtasks: [x/y complete]
✓ next: [next action]
```

## 🔄 integration with memory bank

task tracking integrates with memory bank:

```mermaid
graph td
    tasksfile["tasks.md"] --> active["activecontext.md"]
    tasksfile --> progress["progress.md"]
    
    active -->|"current focus"| tasksfile
    progress -->|"completion status"| tasksfile
```

## 🚨 tasks.md primacy principle

remember:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ tasks.md is the single source of truth for all      │
│ task tracking. all task updates must be reflected   │
│ in tasks.md immediately.                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

this ensures everyone has visibility into current task status at all times.
