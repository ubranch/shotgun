# basic reflection for level 2 tasks

> **tldr:** this document outlines a basic reflection approach for level 2 (simple enhancement) tasks, ensuring that key insights and lessons are captured without unnecessary overhead.

## 🔍 reflection overview

reflection is essential for improving future work, even for simpler level 2 enhancements. this basic reflection approach focuses on key outcomes, challenges, and lessons learned while maintaining efficiency.

## 📋 reflection principles

1. **honesty**: accurately represent successes and challenges
2. **specificity**: include concrete examples and observations
3. **insight**: go beyond surface observations to derive useful insights
4. **improvement**: focus on actionable takeaways for future work
5. **efficiency**: keep reflection concise and focused on key learnings

## 📋 basic reflection structure

```markdown
# level 2 enhancement reflection: [feature name]

## enhancement summary
[brief one-paragraph summary of the enhancement]

## what went well
- [specific success point 1]
- [specific success point 2]
- [specific success point 3]

## challenges encountered
- [specific challenge 1]
- [specific challenge 2]
- [specific challenge 3]

## solutions applied
- [solution to challenge 1]
- [solution to challenge 2]
- [solution to challenge 3]

## key technical insights
- [technical insight 1]
- [technical insight 2]
- [technical insight 3]

## process insights
- [process insight 1]
- [process insight 2]
- [process insight 3]

## action items for future work
- [specific action item 1]
- [specific action item 2]
- [specific action item 3]

## time estimation accuracy
- estimated time: [x hours/days]
- actual time: [y hours/days]
- variance: [z%]
- reason for variance: [brief explanation]
```

## 📋 reflection quality

high-quality reflections for level 2 tasks should:

1. **provide specific examples** rather than vague statements
2. **identify concrete takeaways** not general observations
3. **connect challenges to solutions** with clear reasoning
4. **analyze estimation accuracy** to improve future planning
5. **generate actionable improvements** for future work

## 📋 reflection process

follow these steps for effective level 2 task reflection:

1. **schedule reflection**:
   - allocate dedicated time for reflection
   - complete reflection within 24 hours of task completion

2. **gather information**:
   - review the original task requirements
   - examine implementation details
   - consider challenges encountered
   - review time tracking data

3. **complete template**:
   - fill in all sections of the reflection template
   - include specific, concrete examples
   - be honest about challenges

4. **extract insights**:
   - identify patterns in challenges
   - connect challenges to potential future improvements
   - consider process improvements

5. **document action items**:
   - create specific, actionable improvements
   - link these to future tasks where applicable

6. **store reflection**:
   - save reflection with the task archive
   - add cross-references to relevant documents

## 📋 examples: vague vs. specific entries

### ❌ vague entries (insufficient)

- "the implementation went well."
- "we had some challenges with the code."
- "the feature works as expected."

### ✅ specific entries (sufficient)

- "the modular approach allowed for easy integration with the existing codebase, specifically the clean separation between the ui layer and data processing logic."
- "challenge: the state management became complex when handling multiple user interactions. solution: implemented a more structured reducer pattern with clear actions and state transitions."
- "action item: create a reusable component for file selection that handles all the edge cases we encountered in this implementation."

## 📋 reflection verification checklist

```
✓ reflection verification
- all template sections completed? [yes/no]
- specific examples provided? [yes/no]
- challenges honestly addressed? [yes/no]
- concrete solutions documented? [yes/no]
- actionable insights generated? [yes/no]
- time estimation analyzed? [yes/no]

→ if all yes: reflection complete
→ if any no: improve reflection quality
```

## 📋 minimal mode reflection

for minimal mode, use this format:

```
✓ reflection: [feature name]
✓ went well: [key success]
✓ challenge: [key challenge]
✓ solution: [key solution]
✓ insight: [most important takeaway]
✓ action: [top priority action item]
✓ time: est [x] vs. actual [y] ([z%] variance)
```

## 🔄 integration with memory bank

reflection integrates with memory bank:

```mermaid
graph td
    reflection["enhancement<br>reflection"] --> archive["add to<br>archive"]
    reflection --> progressupdate["update<br>progress.md"]
    reflection --> actionitems["document<br>action items"]
    
    actionitems --> tasks["add to<br>tasks.md"]
    archive & progressupdate & tasks --> crosslinks["create<br>cross-links"]
```

## 🚨 continuous improvement principle

remember:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ every reflection should produce at least one        │
│ actionable improvement for future work.             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

this ensures that reflection directly contributes to ongoing improvement of both the product and the process.
