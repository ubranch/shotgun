# level 3 reflection: intermediate feature review

> **tldr:** this guide structures the reflection process for a completed level 3 intermediate feature. the focus is on a detailed review of the entire feature development lifecycle, from planning and design through implementation and testing, to extract meaningful lessons and identify improvements for future feature work.

## üîç level 3 reflection process

the goal is to create a comprehensive `memory-bank/reflection/reflection-[feature_id].md` document.

## üìù structure for `memory-bank/reflection-[feature_id].md`

  * **feature name & id:**
  * **date of reflection:**
  * **brief feature summary:** (what was built?)
  * **1. overall outcome & requirements alignment:**
      * how well did the final feature meet the initial requirements?
      * were there any deviations from the original scope? if so, why?
      * what is the overall assessment of the feature's success?
  * **2. planning phase review:**
      * how effective was the guidance from `level3/planning-comprehensive.mdc`?
      * was the initial plan in `tasks.md` (component breakdown, strategy, risks) accurate and helpful?
      * what could have been planned better? were estimations (if made) accurate?
  * **3. creative phase(s) review (if applicable):**
      * were the right aspects flagged for creative mode?
      * how effective were the design decisions made in `creative-*.md` documents?
      * did these designs translate well into practical implementation? any friction points?
      * was `memory-bank/style-guide.md` clear and sufficient for ui aspects?
  * **4. implementation phase review:**
      * what were the major successes during implementation? (e.g., efficient module development, good use of libraries)
      * what were the biggest challenges or roadblocks? how were they overcome?
      * were there any unexpected technical difficulties or complexities?
      * how was adherence to the style guide and coding standards?
  * **5. testing phase review:**
      * was the testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e for the feature) effective?
      * did testing uncover significant issues early enough?
      * what could improve the testing process for similar features?
  * **6. what went well? (highlight 3-5 key positives across all phases for this feature)**
  * **7. what could have been done differently? (identify 3-5 areas for improvement)**
  * **8. key lessons learned:**
      * **technical:** new insights about technologies, patterns, or architecture used for this feature.
      * **process:** insights about the l3 workflow, communication, task management.
      * **estimation (if applicable):** lessons about estimating work for features of this scale.
  * **9. actionable improvements for future l3 features:** (specific suggestions)

## üéØ focus areas for l3 reflection

  * **feature scope management:** was the scope well-defined and managed?
  * **integration complexity:** challenges or successes in integrating the feature with the existing application.
  * **design-to-implementation fidelity:** how closely did the final product match the designs?
  * **cross-component impact:** understanding the ripple effects of the feature.
