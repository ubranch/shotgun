# level 3 archive: intermediate feature documentation

> **tldr:** this guide outlines the archiving process for a completed level 3 intermediate feature. the aim is to create a self-contained, easily accessible record of the feature's development lifecycle, including its planning, design decisions, implementation summary, and reflection.

## üöÄ before you start archiving (l3 pre-archive checklist)

1.  **confirm reflection complete:** verify in `memory-bank/tasks.md` that the reflection phase for this feature is marked as complete and `memory-bank/reflection-[feature_id].md` exists and is finalized.
2.  **gather all feature-specific documents:**
    * the feature plan section from `memory-bank/tasks.md` (or a copy of it).
    * all `memory-bank/creative/creative-[aspect_name].md` documents related to this feature.
    * the `memory-bank/reflection/reflection-[feature_id].md` document.
    * key diagrams or architectural notes from `memory-bank/progress.md` if not captured elsewhere.
    * a link to the primary commit(s) or feature branch merge for the implemented code.

## üìù structure for `memory-bank/archive/feature-[featurenameorid]_yyyymmdd.md`

  * **feature title:** (e.g., "archive: user profile feature - avatar upload enhancement")
  * **feature id (from `tasks.md`):**
  * **date archived:** yyyy-mm-dd
  * **status:** completed & archived
  * **1. feature overview:**
      * brief description of the feature and its purpose (can be extracted from `tasks.md` or `projectbrief.md`).
      * link to the original task entry/plan in `tasks.md` (if `tasks.md` is versioned or kept historically).
  * **2. key requirements met:**
      * list the main functional and non-functional requirements this feature addressed.
  * **3. design decisions & creative outputs:**
      * summary of key design choices.
      * direct links to all relevant `memory-bank/creative/creative-[aspect_name].md` documents.
      * link to `memory-bank/style-guide.md` version used (if applicable).
  * **4. implementation summary:**
      * high-level overview of how the feature was implemented.
      * list of primary new components/modules created.
      * key technologies or libraries utilized specifically for this feature.
      * link to the main feature branch merge commit or primary code location/pull request.
  * **5. testing overview:**
      * brief summary of the testing strategy employed for this feature (unit, integration, e2e).
      * outcome of the testing.
  * **6. reflection & lessons learned:**
      * direct link to `memory-bank/reflection/reflection-[feature_id].md`.
      * optionally, copy 1-2 most critical lessons directly into the archive summary.
  * **7. known issues or future considerations (optional, if any remaining from reflection):**
      * any minor known issues deferred.
      * potential future enhancements related to this feature.

## üìå what to emphasize in l3 archiving

  * **self-contained feature record:** the goal is to have a go-to document in the archive that summarizes the "story" of this feature.
  * **traceability:** easy navigation from the archive summary to detailed planning, design, and reflection documents.
  * **maintainability focus:** information that would help a future developer understand, maintain, or build upon this specific feature.
  * **not a full system archive:** unlike level 4, this is not about archiving the entire application state, but rather the lifecycle of one significant feature.
