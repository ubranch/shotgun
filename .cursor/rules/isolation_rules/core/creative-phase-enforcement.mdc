# creative phase enforcement

> **tldr:** this document implements strict enforcement of creative phase requirements for level 3-4 tasks, ensuring all design decisions are properly documented and verified before implementation can proceed.

## 🔍 enforcement workflow

## 🚨 enforcement gates

```mermaid
graph td
    subgraph "creative phase gates"
    g1["entry gate<br>verify requirements"]
    g2["process gate<br>verify progress"]
    g3["exit gate<br>verify completion"]
    end
    
    g1 --> g2 --> g3
    
    style g1 fill:#4dbb5f,stroke:#36873f,color:white

## 📋 enforcement checklist

```markdown
## entry gate verification
- [ ] task complexity is level 3-4
- [ ] design decisions identified
- [ ] creative phase requirements documented
- [ ] required participants notified

## process gate verification
- [ ] all options being considered
- [ ] pros/cons documented
- [ ] technical constraints identified
- [ ] implementation impacts assessed

## exit gate verification
- [ ] all decisions documented
- [ ] rationale provided for choices
- [ ] implementation plan outlined
- [ ] verification against requirements
```

## 🚨 implementation block notice

when a creative phase is required but not completed:

```
🚨 implementation blocked
creative phases must be completed before implementation.

required creative phases:
- [ ] [creative phase 1]
- [ ] [creative phase 2]
- [ ] [creative phase 3]

⛔ this is a hard block
implementation cannot proceed until all creative phases are completed.
type "phase.review" to begin creative phase review.
```

## ✅ verification protocol

```mermaid
graph td
    subgraph "verification steps"
    v1["1. requirements<br>check"]
    v2["2. documentation<br>review"]
    v3["3. decision<br>validation"]
    v4["4. implementation<br>readiness"]
    end
    
    v1 --> v2 --> v3 --> v4
    
    style v1 fill:#4dbb5f,stroke:#36873f,color:white
    style v2 fill:#ffa64d,stroke:#cc7a30,color:white
    style v3 fill:#d94dbb,stroke:#a3378a,color:white
    style v4 fill:#4dbbbb,stroke:#368787,color:white
```

## 🔄 creative phase markers

use these markers to clearly indicate creative phase boundaries:

```markdown
🎨🎨🎨 entering creative phase: [type] 🎨🎨🎨
focus: [specific component/feature]
objective: [clear goal of this creative phase]
requirements: [list of requirements]

[creative phase content]

🎨 creative checkpoint: [milestone]
- progress: [status]
- decisions: [list]
- next steps: [plan]

🎨🎨🎨 exiting creative phase 🎨🎨🎨
summary: [brief description]
key decisions: [list]
next steps: [implementation plan]
