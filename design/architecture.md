# Shotgun App Architecture

## 1. Overview

The Shotgun App is a desktop application built using Wails (v2) and Vue.js (v3).
Wails allows for building cross-platform desktop applications with a Go backend and a web-based frontend.

-   **Backend:** Go. Handles file system operations, logic for identifying files/folders to exclude, and generation of the "Shotgun" text output.
-   **Frontend:** Vue.js (with Vite). Provides the user interface for folder selection, displaying the file/folder tree, marking items for exclusion, and showing the generated output.
-   **Communication:** Wails handles the binding between Go functions and JavaScript calls from the frontend.

## 2. Backend (Go)

The Go backend is structured into a `main` package.

### Key Components:

-   **`main.go`**:
    -   Initializes Wails.
    -   Sets up the application window and options.
    -   Binds the `App` struct methods to be callable from the frontend.
    -   Embeds the frontend assets.
-   **`app.go`**:
    -   **`App` struct**: Holds application state or context if needed (e.g., `context.Context`).
    -   **`startup(ctx context.Context)`**: Wails lifecycle hook, stores the context.
    -   **`FileNode` struct**: Represents a file or folder in the tree. Includes `Name`, `Path`, `RelPath`, `IsDir`, `Children`, and `Excluded` (for UI state).
    -   **`ListFiles(dirPath string) ([]*FileNode, error)`**:
        -   Takes a directory path as input.
        -   Creates a single root `FileNode` representing `dirPath` itself.
        -   The `Name` of this root node is the base name of `dirPath`.
        -   The `RelPath` of this root node is `"."`.
        -   `IsDir` for this root node is `true`.
        -   Its `Children` are populated by recursively scanning the `dirPath`.
        -   This recursive scan builds a tree structure of `FileNode` objects for the contents of `dirPath`.
        -   Uses `os.ReadDir` and `path/filepath` for file system interaction.
        -   Sorts entries (directories first, then by name).
        -   Returns a slice containing only the single root `FileNode` to the frontend.
    -   **`GenerateShotgunOutput(rootDir string, excludedPaths []string) (string, error)`**:
        -   Takes the root directory path and a list of relative paths to exclude.
        -   **Tree Generation**:
            -   Recursively traverses the `rootDir`.
            -   Skips any file or folder whose relative path is in `excludedPaths`. If a folder is excluded, its children are also skipped.
            -   Builds a textual tree representation (e.g., using `├──`, `└──`, `│`).
        -   **File Content Aggregation**:
            -   For each non-excluded file:
                -   Reads its content.
                -   Formats it according to the specified `*#*#*...*#*#*begin*#*#* ... *#*#*end*#*#*` structure.
                -   `filepath_inside_project_dir` is calculated relative to `rootDir`.
        -   **Final Output**:
            -   Concatenates the tree structure, a blank line, and all formatted file contents.
            -   Returns the complete string.

### Wails Integration:

-   The `App` struct and its public methods (`ListFiles`, `GenerateShotgunOutput`) are bound using `wails.Run(&options.App{Bind: ...})`.
-   Wails automatically generates JavaScript bindings in `frontend/wailsjs/go/main/App.js` for these methods, allowing the frontend to call them.
-   For folder selection, the Go backend can expose a method that uses `runtime.OpenDirectoryDialog` from the Wails runtime package. This method is then bound and called from the frontend.

## 3. Frontend (Vue.js)

The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Vue 3 (Composition API), Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
It implements a multi-step user interface to guide the user through the process of preparing project context, composing prompts, executing them, and applying patches.

### Key Components:

-   **`main.js`**: Entry point for the Vue application. Initializes Vue and mounts the root `App.vue` component.
-   **`App.vue`**: Root component.
    -   Mounts the `MainLayout.vue` component, which orchestrates the overall UI.
-   **`components/MainLayout.vue`**:
    -   **Overall Structure**: Manages the main layout consisting of a horizontal stepper, a left sidebar, a central content panel, and a bottom console.
    -   **State Management (using `ref` and `reactive`)**:
        -   `currentStep`: Tracks the active step in the multi-step process (1-4).
        -   `steps`: An array of step objects, each with an `id`, `title`, and `completed` status.
        -   `logMessages`: Array for storing messages to be displayed in the `BottomConsole`.
    -   **Core Logic**:
        -   Handles navigation between steps via `navigateToStep`.
        -   Manages actions triggered from step components via `handleStepAction`, orchestrating the flow between steps and simulating backend interactions.
        -   Updates step completion status.
-   **`components/HorizontalStepper.vue`**:
    -   Displays the steps (1-4) horizontally at the top of the application.
    -   Highlights the current step and marks completed steps.
    -   Allows navigation to completed steps or the next uncompleted step.
-   **`components/LeftSidebar.vue`**:
    -   A persistent sidebar on the left.
    -   Contains a placeholder for a `FileTree.vue` component (for displaying project file structure).
    -   Displays a list of steps (e.g., "1. Prepare Context", "2. Compose Prompt"), allowing navigation similar to the `HorizontalStepper`.
-   **`components/CentralPanel.vue`**:
    -   The main content area that dynamically renders the component for the current active step.
    -   Uses `v-if` directives based on `currentStep` to show one of the following step-specific components:
        -   `components/steps/Step1CopyStructure.vue` (handles "Prepare Context")
        -   `components/steps/Step2GenerateDiff.vue` (handles "Compose Prompt")
        -   `components/steps/Step3ExecuteDiff.vue` (handles "Execute Prompt")
        -   `components/steps/Step4ApplyPatch.vue`
    -   Forwards actions from step components to `MainLayout.vue`.
    -   Exposes methods like `updateStep2DiffOutput` and `addLogToStep3Console` to allow `MainLayout.vue` to push data into specific step components (e.g., diff output into Step 2, logs into Step 3's console).
-   **`components/steps/Step1CopyStructure.vue`** (handles "Prepare Context"):
    -   UI for the first step.
    -   Contains a "Prepare Project Context & Proceed" button.
    -   Emits an action (e.g., `prepareContext`) to `MainLayout.vue` to signify completion and move to the next step.
-   **`components/steps/Step2GenerateDiff.vue`** (handles "Compose Prompt"):
    -   UI for the second step.
    -   Includes a `<textarea>` for the user to input their prompt for the LLM.
    -   A "Compose Prompt" button that triggers an action (e.g., `composePrompt`) with the prompt text.
    -   A `<pre>` block to display the diff output received from `MainLayout.vue`.
-   **`components/steps/Step3ExecuteDiff.vue`** (handles "Execute Prompt"):
    -   UI for the third step.
    -   A "Execute Prompt" button (e.g., `executePrompt`).
-   **`components/steps/Step4ApplyPatch.vue`**:
    -   UI for the fourth step.
    -   A placeholder for an interactive patch editor (shows stubbed hunks with checkboxes).
    -   "Apply Selected" and "Apply All & Finish" buttons.
-   **`components/BottomConsole.vue`**:
    -   A console area at the bottom of the application.
    -   Displays general execution status logs passed from `MainLayout.vue`.
    -   Typically visible from Step 3 onwards.
-   **`components/FileTree.vue`**: (Currently a stub in `LeftSidebar.vue`, based on previous architecture)
    -   Intended to be a recursive component to display the file/folder tree.
    -   Props: `nodes` (array of `FileNode`), `projectRoot`.
    -   Will allow users to view the project structure. (Interaction for exclusion marking was part of the previous design and may be re-integrated or adapted).
-   **`assets/main.css`**: Includes Tailwind CSS directives and minimal global styles.
-   **`tailwind.config.js` & `postcss.config.js`**: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.
-   **`index.html`**: Main HTML file.
-   **`vite.config.js`**: Vite build configuration.
-   **`package.json`**: Frontend project metadata and dependencies (Vue, Vite, Tailwind CSS).

### Wails Integration:

-   (As per previous architecture) Frontend calls Go methods via `import { MethodName } from '../../wailsjs/go/main/App';`.
-   The Go backend methods like `ListFiles` and `GenerateShotgunOutput` (and a potential `SelectDirectory` wrapper) are still relevant for providing data and performing core operations. The new UI will now trigger these at different stages of its multi-step process. For example, `ListFiles` might be called after an initial project selection step (implicitly part of or preceding Step 1), and `GenerateShotgunOutput` (or a similar method for LLM interaction) would be relevant around Step 2/3.

## 4. Data Flow & Application Logic (Multi-Step UI)

The application operates based on a sequence of steps, managed by `MainLayout.vue`:

1.  **Initialization (Step 1: Prepare Context)**:
    -   The application starts at Step 1.
    -   `CentralPanel.vue` displays `Step1CopyStructure.vue`.
    -   User Action: Clicks "Prepare Project Context & Proceed".
    -   `Step1CopyStructure.vue` emits an `action` (e.g., `prepareContext`) to `MainLayout.vue`.
    -   `MainLayout.vue` handles the action:
        -   Simulates a backend call (e.g., `GenerateShotgunOutput` to prepare the context).
        -   Logs the action to `BottomConsole.vue` (if visible) and potentially to a step-specific console.
        -   Marks Step 1 as completed.
        -   Advances `currentStep` to 2.

2.  **Step 2: Compose Prompt**:
    -   `CentralPanel.vue` now displays `Step2GenerateDiff.vue`.
    -   User Action: Enters a prompt in the textarea and clicks "Compose Prompt".
    -   `Step2GenerateDiff.vue` emits an `action` (e.g., `composePrompt`) with the prompt payload to `MainLayout.vue`.
    -   `MainLayout.vue` handles the action:
        -   Simulates a backend call to an LLM (this would involve sending the prompt and context to an LLM to get a diff).
        -   Receives a mock diff output.
        -   Calls `centralPanelRef.value.updateStep2DiffOutput(mockDiff)` to send the diff to `Step2GenerateDiff.vue` for display.
        -   Logs the action.
        -   Marks Step 2 as completed.
        -   Advances `currentStep` to 3.

3.  **Step 3: Execute Prompt**:
    -   `CentralPanel.vue` displays `Step3ExecuteDiff.vue`.
    -   `BottomConsole.vue` becomes visible (or more active).
    -   User Action: Clicks "Execute Prompt".
    -   `Step3ExecuteDiff.vue` emits an `action` (e.g., `executePrompt`) to `MainLayout.vue`.
    -   `MainLayout.vue` handles the action:
        -   Simulates the execution of the diff (e.g., applying changes in memory or preparing for a patch, this is conceptual for "executing the prompt's intent").
        -   Sends logs specifically to `Step3ExecuteDiff.vue`'s console via `centralPanelRef.value.addLogToStep3Console(message, type)`.
        -   Also sends general logs to `BottomConsole.vue`.
        -   Marks Step 3 as completed.
        -   Advances `currentStep` to 4.

4.  **Step 4: Apply Patch**:
    -   `CentralPanel.vue` displays `Step4ApplyPatch.vue`.
    -   User Action: Interacts with the (stubbed) patch editor (e.g., selecting hunks) and clicks "Apply Selected" or "Apply All & Finish".
    -   `Step4ApplyPatch.vue` emits an `action` (e.g., `applySelectedPatches` or `applyAllPatches`) to `MainLayout.vue`.
    -   `MainLayout.vue` handles the action:
        -   Simulates applying the patches to the file system.
        -   Logs the final actions.
        -   Marks Step 4 as completed.
        -   The process might conclude, or allow for further iterations/restarts.

**Navigation & State**:
-   `HorizontalStepper.vue` and `LeftSidebar.vue` allow navigation between steps. Users can typically go back to completed steps or forward to the next uncompleted step.
-   The `completed` status of each step in `MainLayout.vue`'s `steps` ref controls navigability and visual state.
-   The `FileTree.vue` component in the `LeftSidebar.vue` is intended to display the project's file structure. Its interaction with the steps (e.g., updating after a patch is applied in Step 4) will be a key part of future development.

## Asynchronous Project Context Generation

The project context, which is the text output displayed in the "Prepare Context" step (Step 1), is now generated asynchronously to improve user experience and UI responsiveness. The key aspects of this implementation are:

1.  **Automatic Regeneration**: Whenever there are relevant changes in the selected project's file and folder tree (e.g., toggling exclusions, changing ignore rules, or selecting a new project directory), the project context is automatically regenerated in a background goroutine on the Go side. This ensures that the UI does not freeze during potentially long operations.

2.  **Loading Indication**: While the context is being generated, the frontend displays a visual loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) in the area where the context text will appear. This informs the user that an operation is in progress.

3.  **Job Cancellation and Debouncing**: If multiple changes occur in quick succession, the system employs a debouncing mechanism. This means that a new generation job is not started for every single change. Instead, it waits for a short period of inactivity before triggering the generation. If new changes occur while a generation job is already running, the ongoing job is cancelled, and a new one is started with the latest state of the file tree and exclusion rules. This prevents unnecessary computation and ensures the final output reflects the most recent user selections.

4.  **Elimination of Manual Trigger**: Due to the automatic and reactive nature of context generation, the manual "Prepare Project Context & Proceed" button has been removed from Step 1. The context is always kept up-to-date or is in the process of being updated.

This asynchronous approach ensures that the application remains interactive and provides a smoother experience, especially when working with large project structures.

## 5. Cross-Platform Considerations

-   **Wails**: Natively supports building for Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single codebase.
-   **Go**: Standard library functions like `os` and `path/filepath` are cross-platform, handling path separators and OS-specific details.
-   **Frontend**: Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) are inherently cross-platform.

## 6. Simplicity and Minimal Libraries

-   **Go Backend**: Relies primarily on the Go standard library. Wails is the main external dependency.
-   **Vue Frontend**: Uses Vue 3, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The UI components for the stepper, panels, and steps are custom built.
-   This approach aims to keep the application maintainable and focused, leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling efficiency.
