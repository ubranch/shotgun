## theme migration progress

### completed
- defined comprehensive color scheme css variables in `custom.css` for both light and dark modes
- refactored tailwind configuration to reference new theme variables for unified styling
- implemented `themeprovider.vue` to manage and provide theme context (light/dark) across the app
- migrated primary ui components to use theme variables:
  - `basebutton.vue`
  - `mainlayout.vue`
  - `leftsidebar.vue`
  - `centralpanel.vue`
  - `customrulesmodal.vue`
  - `horizontalstepper.vue`

### in progress
- refactoring remaining components to eliminate hardcoded dark mode classes
- validating theme toggle logic and persistence
- auditing for consistent application of theme variables throughout all ui elements

### next steps
- finalize migration for step components:
  - `step1preparecontext.vue`
  - `step2composeprompt.vue`
  - `step3executeprompt.vue`
  - `step4applypatch.vue`
- update `filetree.vue` to fully support theme system
- expose theme switching control in user interface for accessibility
- conduct cross-mode testing to ensure visual and functional consistency in both light and dark themes
