# active context

currently working on fixing the file tree selection and context generation issue. this is a level 3 (intermediate feature) task focused on resolving a critical bug where toggling files in the file tree does not update the generated context.

key components involved:
- frontend/src/components/filetree.vue: handles ui for file selection
- frontend/src/components/mainlayout.vue: manages file tree state and context generation
- frontend/src/components/steps/step1preparecontext.vue: displays generated context
- app.go: backend handling of context generation based on excluded paths

implementation status:
- implementation plan created and documented in tasks.md
- debug logging added to trace the issue
- identified problem in toggleExcludeNode function not triggering context regeneration
- fixed the function to force context regeneration after toggle
- enhanced file tree component to ensure toggle events are properly emitted
- updated watch functionality to clear context when file tree changes
- fixed event handling in LeftSidebar component
- added handling for contextGeneratedLocal events in MainLayout
- testing completed: all fixes confirmed working properly
- documentation completed: changes documented in tasks.md

next steps:
- create reflection document
- create archive document

## theme system overview

the application implements a robust, css variable-driven theme system supporting both light and dark modes. the architecture consists of:

1. **css variable definitions**: all theme tokens are declared in `frontend/src/assets/custom.css` under `:root` for light mode and `.dark` for dark mode, enabling dynamic theme switching at runtime.

2. **tailwindcss integration**: `tailwind.config.js` is configured to reference these css variables, ensuring all tailwind utility classes inherit the current theme context for seamless design consistency.

3. **theme provider component**: `themeprovider.vue` centrally manages theme state, exposes a toggle function, and provides theme context to all child components using vue's provide/inject pattern.

4. **component refactor**: all major ui components have migrated from static color values to referencing the new theme variables, ensuring full theme compliance and easier future adjustments.

primary theme variables include:

- `--background`, `--foreground`: main surface and text colors
- `--card`, `--card-foreground`: card/container backgrounds and text
- `--primary`, `--primary-foreground`: primary action and contrast
- `--secondary`, `--secondary-foreground`: secondary ui elements
- `--accent`, `--accent-foreground`: highlights and accents
- `--destructive`, `--destructive-foreground`: error and warning states
- `--sidebar`, `--sidebar-foreground`: sidebar-specific palette
- `--muted`, `--muted-foreground`: subdued/disabled elements

the system also defines variables for borders, shadows, and typography, providing a unified, scalable design foundation across the app.
