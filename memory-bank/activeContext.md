## active tasks

[no active tasks]

## current status

implementation and documentation phases completed. the task has been fully implemented, tested, documented, and archived. the context statistics feature now displays line count and file size information under the "generated project context:" heading in the first step of the application workflow.

## recent activities

- completed context statistics implementation in step1preparecontext.vue
- added computed property to calculate statistics
- modified ui to display line count and file size
- tested functionality with different project sizes
- created reflection document (reflection-context-statistics.md)
- created archive document (archive-context-statistics.md)
- updated tasks.md and progress.md with completion status

## project analysis

shotgun is a desktop application built with wails (go backend, vue frontend) that helps users with prompt engineering and testing. the application follows a structured 4-step workflow:

1. **prepare context**: select project folder and generate context
2. **compose prompt**: craft prompts using the project context
3. **execute prompt**: process the ai-generated code changes
4. **apply patch**: implement the generated changes

the recently completed task enhances the first step (prepare context) by displaying statistics about the generated context:
- line count of the generated context
- file size of the generated context in kilobytes

these statistics provide users with valuable information about the size and complexity of their project context.

## implementation details

the implementation involved the following key changes:

1. **computed property for statistics:**
```javascript
const contextStats = computed(() => {
    if (!props.generatedContext) return { lines: 0, sizeKb: 0 };

    const lines = props.generatedContext.split('\n').length;
    const sizeKb = (props.generatedContext.length / 1024).toFixed(1);

    return { lines, sizeKb };
});
```

2. **ui modification to display statistics:**
```html
<div>
    <h3 class="text-md font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        generated project context:
    </h3>
    <p v-if="generatedContext" class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
        {{ contextStats.lines }} lines ({{ contextStats.sizeKb }} kb)
    </p>
</div>
```

this enhancement provides users with immediate feedback about the size and complexity of their project context.

## technical environment

- **operating system**: windows 10/11 (windows_nt 10.0 26100 x86_64)
- **runtime**: go v1.24.4
- **frontend framework**: vue.js with tailwind css
- **backend framework**: wails (go)
- **package manager**: pnpm (frontend), go modules (backend)

## setup requirements

- go 1.24.0 or higher
- node.js and pnpm for frontend development
- google api key for gemini token counting (set via environment variable)

## next steps

awaiting new task assignment.
